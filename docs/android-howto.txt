Notes about the Android API

To go from one activity to another:
	Intent intent = new Intent(FirstActivity.this, SecondActivity.class);
	startActivity(intent);
	
'Clean' your project if you have compile errors about R. This will delete and re-generate the R file. The R file is the mapping between XML and code.

Make sure you refresh and clean your project after doing a git pull.
