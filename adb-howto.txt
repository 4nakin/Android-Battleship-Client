Notes about ADB

Make sure ADB is on your path. it's in android-sdk-windows/platform-tools/adb.exe
In a command prompt: 
adb devices
if it just says list of devices attached with nothing underneath it, it means your phone was not recognized.
Either install the drivers, enable USB Debugging, or try reconnecting or rebooting the phone.

adb logcat
Shows everything that every application is printing (Sometimes necessary to see stack traces)

adb logcat Battleship:V *:S
Shows everything our application printed through Log.i() or Log.e() or Log.anything


Eclipse has logcat built in, you can create a filter to get the output of the second command.
